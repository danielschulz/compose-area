A compose area with support for Emoji, written with Rust + Webassembly.

Demo: https://threema-ch.github.io/compose-area/

Project status: Alpha, still working out initial bugs.


## Concepts

This project provides a simple text editor with support for media content (e.g.
emoji), implemented on top of a content editable div.

The input handling is done entirely by the browser. The library should be
notified every time the caret position is changed, so it can update its
internal state. It provides methods to insert text, images or other block
elements. Selection and caret position are handled automatically.


## Usage

First, import the library.

```js
import * as wasm from 'compose-area';
```

Next, bind to the wrapper element (a div with the specified `id`):

```js
const composeArea = wasm.bind_to('wrapper');
```

Because the insertion should work even when there is no selection / focus
inside the compose area, the library needs to know about all selection change
events. Register them using an event listener:

```js
document.addEventListener('selectionchange', (e) => {
    composeArea.store_selection_range();
});
```

Now you can start typing inside the compose area. It behaves like a regular
content editable div.

To insert text or images through code, use the following two functions:

```js
//                       src          alt   class
composeArea.insert_image("emoji.jpg", "ðŸ˜€", "emoji");

//                      text
composeArea.insert_text("hello");
```

To extract the text from the area, there's also a method:

```js
composeArea.get_text();
```
